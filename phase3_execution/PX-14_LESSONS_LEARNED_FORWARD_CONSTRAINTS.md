# PX-14: Lessons Learned & Operational Forward Constraints
**Project**: Persistent 25+ Agent Simulation Laboratory (Curo SimLab)  
**Phase**: Phase 3 Controlled Reproduction Execution  

---

## 1. Retrospective & Disproved Assumptions

1. **The Equal-Weighting Myth**: The published claim in Generative Agents that equal weights ($\alpha=\beta=\gamma=1$) produce optimal memory retrieval is disproven. Relevance must strictly dominate recency and importance ($\beta > \alpha + \gamma$) to prevent agents from retrieving recent irrelevant noise.
2. **The Debate-as-Reasoner Myth**: Multi-agent debate does not provide large collaborative surplus on closed symbolic reasoning. It is an information reconciliation tool, not a reasoning amplifier.
3. **The Neural Orchestrator Trap**: Complex learned meta-orchestrators are unnecessary when multi-feature heuristic rules achieve sufficient quality and token reduction with zero latency overhead.

## 2. Cumulative Operational Negative Constraints Master Register (NC-01 through NC-46)

All subsequent SimLab phases (Phase 4 Ablations through Phase 10) must strictly consume and enforce these forty-six binding negative forward constraints:

### 2.1 Gate R1 Technical & Architectural Constraints (NC-01 to NC-16)
- `NC-01`: **NO Unvalidated Prompt-Based Governance**: Never use natural language prompts for access control; enforce via deterministic Cedar/OPA policy engines.
- `NC-02`: **NO Content-Unbound Critic Approvals & Mutable Filesystem TOCTOU**: Approvals must bind SHA-256 hashes with Ed25519 signatures and immutable CAS URIs.
- `NC-03`: **NO Unattenuated, Holder-Unbound, or Same-Tick Replayable Capability Tokens**: Capability tokens require DPoP public key binding and monotonic sequence counters.
- `NC-04`: **NO Unconditional Correlation for Critic Independence Metrics**: Evaluate conditional independence of residual errors given ground truth ($CIM_{\text{residual}}$).
- `NC-05`: **NO Uninspected Code Artifact Handoffs or Smuggled String Literal Injections**: AST sanitization and string literal token replacement before critic evaluation.
- `NC-06`: **NO Unseeded Randomness or Floating-Point Time in Simulation Kernels**: Discrete integer ticks and pinned `SeedSequence` PRNGs.
- `NC-07`: **NO File-Polling Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: In-memory async message queues (ZeroMQ/AsyncIO) only.
- `NC-08`: **NO Inverted or Rank-Indexed Recency Decay Formulations**: Exponential decay over verified elapsed simulation ticks ($\lambda^{\Delta T}$).
- `NC-09`: **NO Ungrounded Homogeneous Multi-Agent Debate Loops**: Require model heterogeneity and deterministic validation tools at each round.
- `NC-10`: **NO Compute-Unnormalized Multi-Agent Comparative Claims**: Mandatory single-agent control ($B1-SC$) matched at equal token spend $\pm 10\%$.
- `NC-11`: **NO Unbudgeted or Uncapped Dynamic Agent Spawning**: Hard static ceilings on agent count, tree depth, and total tokens.
- `NC-12`: **NO Irreversible Early Pruning of Safety/Auditor Roles**: Safety and verification roles must be declared `unprunable: true`.
- `NC-13`: **NO Persistent Cross-Run Memory or Context Carryover**: Ephemeral execution containers with tmpfs memory mounts purged post-run.
- `NC-14`: **NO Self-Approval or Cryptographic Role Aliasing**: Cryptographic invariant: $\operatorname{AuthorIdentity} \neq \operatorname{ReviewerIdentity}$.
- `NC-15`: **NO Floating Model Endpoints or Unpinned Checkpoint Hashes**: Exact immutable snapshot dates and system fingerprint validation.
- `NC-16`: **NO Unconstrained Sandbox Tool Execution Resource Budgets**: Enforce strict CPU timeout (60s), RSS (512MB), and `--network none`.

### 2.2 Gate R1 Methodological & Process Constraints (NC-17 to NC-23)
- `NC-17`: **No Schema-Only Validation**: Require substantive independent review beyond syntactic checks.
- `NC-18`: **Canonical Lifecycle Transition**: State updates must occur atomically upon gate closure.
- `NC-19`: **Strict Mathematical Language**: Distinguish polynomial ($\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) from exponential scaling.
- `NC-20`: **Comprehensive Code Verification**: Trace complete call trees before claiming an implementation gap.
- `NC-21`: **Bounded Benchmark Generalization**: Do not generalize closed reasoning results to social multi-agent simulations.
- `NC-22`: **Substrate vs. Primitive Decoupling**: Separate legacy framework rejection from underlying cognitive primitive validity.
- `NC-23`: **Truth-Driven Audit Assertions**: Query canonical registers dynamically rather than hardcoding regex assumptions.

### 2.3 Gate R2 Reproduction Design Constraints (NC-24 to NC-30)
- `NC-24`: **Minimum Harness Constraint**: Build minimal micro-benchmarks ($\le 300$ lines), never full game worlds.
- `NC-25`: **Deterministic Priority Constraint**: Deterministic assertions and tests always take precedence over subjective LLM judges.
- `NC-26`: **Compute Equivalence Constraint**: Multi-agent comparisons require both call-matched and token-matched $B1-SC$ controls.
- `NC-27`: **Network Egress Firewall & Zero Data Retention**: API calls must pass `store: false` to prevent benchmark leakage.
- `NC-28`: **Failure Pre-Registration Constraint**: Automated run invalidation on model drift (`FM-06`), prompt leakage (`FM-07`), or data contamination (`FM-12`).
- `NC-29`: **Architecture Firewall Invariant**: Reproduction harnesses must not dictate final SimLab schemas; architecture remains `UNFROZEN`.
- `NC-30`: **Execution Authorization Boundary**: Never proceed to execution without explicit requester approval.

### 2.4 Gate R3 Controlled Execution Constraints (NC-31 to NC-40)
- `NC-31`: **Relevance Dominance Invariant**: Never implement memory retrieval scoring where recency or importance weights equal or exceed semantic relevance ($\beta$ must be $\ge 2\alpha$).
- `NC-32`: **Debate Scope Constraint**: Never deploy multi-agent debate for closed symbolic reasoning; restrict debate strictly to partitioned-information, asymmetric-tool, or distributed-observation tasks.
- `NC-33`: **Domain-Scoped SOP Constraint**: Never impose assembly-line sequential SOP phase gates on open-ended emergent social interactions.
- `NC-34`: **Heuristic-First Routing Constraint**: Never deploy neural or reinforcement-learned agent routing without first demonstrating that static and multi-feature heuristic routers fail.
- `NC-35`: **Dual-Control Matching Constraint**: Every future multi-agent evaluation must include both call-matched and token-matched single-agent controls ($B1-SC$).
- `NC-36`: **Non-Parametric Token Audit Constraint**: Always test token distributions for normality; use Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney U when token data is skewed.
- `NC-37`: **Complexity Burden Invariant**: The burden of proof belongs to additional architectural complexity. If a simpler baseline satisfies success thresholds, halt escalation immediately.
- `NC-38`: **Pre-Call Projection Constraint**: Every execution harness must compute projected spend before every paid call to prevent budget overrun.
- `NC-39`: **Model Pinned Fingerprint Invariant**: Never execute experiments against unpinned model checkpoints; track provider system fingerprints.
- `NC-40`: **Phase 4 Authorization Boundary**: Never proceed to Phase 4 ablation testing without explicit, separate human requester authorization.

### 2.5 Gate R3 Post-Reconciliation Constraints (NC-41 to NC-46)
- `NC-41`: **Layered Verification Separation Invariant**: Deterministic package audits verify artifact presence and schema integrity only; they do not prove scientific truth or validate substantive mathematical conclusions. Layer A and Layer B must always remain distinct.
- `NC-42`: **Lifecycle Adjudication Decoupling**: Deterministic audit completion certifies `DETERMINISTIC_AUDIT: PASS` and readiness for adjudication, not `GATE_COMPLETE`. Gate closure requires explicit substantive adjudication.
- `NC-43`: **Stopping-Rule Non-Inferiority Invariant**: Invoking a pre-registered stopping rule (e.g. `STOP_ESCALATION`) establishes that further complexity was unjustified for the evaluated workload; it does not prove that unexecuted treatments are inferior, harmful, or rejected. Unexecuted treatments must be classified strictly as `NOT_TESTED_DUE_TO_STOPPING_RULE`.
- `NC-44`: **Raw Provenance Traceability Constraint**: Every reported aggregate percentage or effect size must remain strictly traceable to raw numerators, denominators, and sample sizes in immutable telemetry. Provisional narrative estimates must never be substituted for empirical counts.
- `NC-45`: **Rigorous Equivalence Specification**: Claims of equivalence must specify explicit pre-registered equivalence bounds ($\delta$) and report both one-sided tests (TOST), confidence intervals, and power.
- `NC-46`: **Mandatory External Validity Delimitation**: Every architecture-relevant finding must be accompanied by explicit negative boundaries stating what the result does *not* support and where generalization is forbidden.
